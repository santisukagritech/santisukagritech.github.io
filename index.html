							<h2 class="major">Industry</h2>
							
							<p>While Europe and North America scramble toward unleashing the potential of the hemp industry, other regions of the world are making small, but substantial, steps towards joining them in the marketplace. Earlier September 2019, <b>Thailand’s Public Health Ministry</b> announced that seeds and oils extracted from hemp would be removed from its <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1740734/hemp-removed-from-list-of-controlled-substances">list of controlled substances</a>.</p>
							<p><i>“The intention is to allow extracts to be used in medicine, cosmetics and food and support hemp as a cash crop.”</i> - Tares Krassanairawiwong, Secretary-General of the Food and Drug Administration in Thailand.</p>
							<p>Thailand hemp industry is expected to grow to $661 Million by 2025 and Asia’s medicinal hemp market could by 2024 be worth $5.8 Billion. <i>The Global State of Hemp: 2019 Industry Outlook</i> predicts continued demand in the latter CBD market will be the main driving force behind the global hemp market’s continued growth.</p>
